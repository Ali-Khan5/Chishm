                thinking perspective, and from a value perspective. We are a

                in pedagogy, teaching, child psychology, project management,
                strategic planning, advisory - sharing a common vision.`}

                the contributions from our members. Every person within Chishm
                is either a member or a volunteer. All decisions are made
                through majority votes of the members, unless a project specific
                policy has been defined. As such, our members are hand-picked
                and often join us as volunteers at first. Members can initiate
                their own projects if a certain number of minimum members agree
                to the project and the projectâ€™s required skill set is complete.
                Through such an approach, Chishm provides a platform for
                motivated and like-minded people to initiate social projects in
                line with our primary goals.`}
