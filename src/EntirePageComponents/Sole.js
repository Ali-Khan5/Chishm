              Programs are Chishmâ€™s long term projects that aim to strengthen
              individuals such as students and teachers from deprived
              communities. Our key long-term project is the Mentoring Program
              which is the cornerstone of Chishm. Through this program, an
              individual person (mentor) is linked with an individual student
              (their mentee) in order to guide and support them through schools
              and institutions.

                Self Organized Learning Environment (SOLE) is an enquiry based
                learning approach where the teachers encourage their class to
                work as a community to answer questions using internet, books
                and other resources. Students are given a big question related
                to a topic and are challenged to find its answer in groups. The
                groups present answers back to the class at the end of the
                session.

                An important prerequisite of SOLE is that teachers and students
                are aware of the basics of computer use. This would require to
                teach them how to start computer, how to use a word document,
                how to acquire information through internet, educate them on the
                positive and negative sides of computer and internet, setting up
                computers and projector, etc. Send us an email if you would like
                more information and would like to be part of it.

              <p>
                The key of SOLE is asking students big questions related to a
                topic of interest that would stimulate their thinking from
                different ways. For example, rather than asking what is the
                importance of trees, one might ask what would happen if all the
                trees in the world were cut down. This would allow them to think
                about the impact on humans, animals, soil, nature, livelihood,
                etc. You can play a part in designing such questions for the
                local curriculum and different classes. In addition, we
                introduce some extra-curricular topics like ethics, civic
                responsibility, etc. You will not have to reinvent the wheel but
                rather start with material we have already developed. Send us an
                email if you would like more information or would like to be
                part of this.

                such as science, technology, health, economics, politics, etc.
                With new information and discoveries coming out every day, our
                current inflexible way of teaching will become obsolete. We
                therefore need to continuously adapt our teaching methods,
                curriculum, etc. We are therefore constantly updating our SOLE
                program. If you would like to get involved in planning and
