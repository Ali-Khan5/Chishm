              <p>
                Chishm is as a non-profit platform to support and enhance the
                quality of education amongst the underprivileged youth of
                Pakistan such as street children and disabled children. Our
                approach aims to reshape the way education is imparted - which
                in turn would reshape the youth of tomorrow: from a critical
                thinking perspective, and from a value perspective. We are a
                group of volunteers from different walks of life - specializing
                in pedagogy, teaching, child psychology, project management,
                strategic planning, advisory - sharing a common vision.Chishm is

              <h2>What Do We Do</h2>
              <p>
                Through our various long-term and short term projects, we
                increase the accessibility of formal education to
                underprivileged communities, increase the quality of education
                being provided to such communities and bridge the gap between
                privileged and underprivileged members of our society through
                community integration. On one hand we have long-term programs to
                provide mentors for weak students / at-risk youth, training
                teachers, enrolling street children into schools etc. On the
                other hand we have short term projects that strengthen the
                educational infrastructure and improve quality of educational
                institutes.
              </p>
              <h2>Whom Do We Serve</h2>
              <p>
                Chishm supports individual children from underprivileged
                communities in Pakistan, educational institutions catering to
                these children and individual teachers working in such
                institutions.
              </p>
              <h2>Where do we get our funding from</h2>
              <p>
                Currently our main funding sources are individual donors. Some
                of them are long term donors who contribute towards education of
                individual children under our mentoring programme by becoming
                their financial sponsors or short term donors who donate towards
                our ongoing or prospective projects. Our operational cost is
                covered by contributions from our members. Therefore every paisa
                donated reaches a beneficiary.
              </p>

              <h2>Organization Structure</h2>

              <p>
                At Chishm, we follow an innovative organizational structure
                through which we are able to eliminate hierarchy and maximize
                the contributions from our members. Every person within Chishm
                is either a member or a volunteer. All decisions are made
                through majority votes of the members, unless a project specific
                policy has been defined. As such, our members are hand-picked
                and often join us as volunteers at first. Members can initiate
                their own projects if a certain number of minimum members agree
                to the project and the projectâ€™s required skill set is complete.
                Through such an approach, Chishm provides a platform for
                motivated and like-minded people to initiate social projects in
                line with our primary goals.
